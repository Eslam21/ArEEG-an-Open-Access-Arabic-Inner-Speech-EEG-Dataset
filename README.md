# ðŸ§  ArEEG: An Open-Access Arabic Inner Speech EEG Dataset

Welcome to the official repository for **ArEEG**, the **first open-access EEG dataset** capturing **inner speech in Arabic**. This dataset is designed to facilitate research in **brain-computer interfaces (BCI)**, **Arabic language processing**, and **neuro-linguistics**.

All the code and scripts provided here will help you **reproduce experiments**, **process EEG signals**, and **build classification models** based on the dataset.

ðŸ“‚ The dataset is hosted publicly on **OpenNeuro**:
